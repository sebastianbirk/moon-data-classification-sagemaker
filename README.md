# Moon Data Classification using PyTorch with Amazon Sagemaker

This repository contains code to train and deploy PyTorch models with Amazon sagemaker to classify moon data that has been created with scitkit-learn.

## General Project Outline

1. Generating the moon data
2. Loading it into an S3 bucket
3. Defining a PyTorch binary classifier
4. Completing a training script
5. Training and deploying the custom model
6. Evaluating its performance
